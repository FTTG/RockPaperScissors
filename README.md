# RockPaperScissors
JS practice for the Odin Project
Creating a version of Rock Paper Scissor that works on the console.

## Upgrades:
Create a UI for the game to be played by clicking on the different RPS buttons.
Use event listeners and also provide results and score on the page while the game is being played.

## Terminology / Notations
* During commits "RPS" will be used to abbreviate "Rock, Paper, Scissors".
* All global variables will be names with an underscore at the start of the name. eg: "_playerScore".
